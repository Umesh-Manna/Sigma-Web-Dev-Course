## what i learned in this video

- inline, block and inline-block property of css
- 
 1. block: entire width
 2. inline: equal to the content inside. Padding-top, margin-top and width properties doesn't work properly.
 3. inline-block: basically inline property without the limitations of inline. 
 The three properties will work perfectly as expected here.
 4. none: as if the element doesn't exist. 
 5. flex: will learn about later
 6. grid: will learn about later

- **visibility** tag, like **display:none** but the empty space remains there.
